### Entry Level Suggestions

* [Create a JSON schema for the Yosys JSON format. #7](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/7)
    For this project, the student will need to learn how JSON files are formatted but I feel that this will not be too difficult.

### Experienced level Suggestions

* [Create a "common configuration" git repository which is auto-merged into SymbiFlow projects #51](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/51)
    This could be a very interesting project, but I feel that it will require understanding the basic formats of all the file types used in symbiflow, which are many.
    It will also involve learning about how the Symbiflow repositories and projects are organized so that the auto merger can be implemented.
    There is also a piece involving Travis CL which would be interesting.
    This issue is a joining of the last few issues that Tim submitted:
        * [#50](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/50)
        * [#49](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/49) -[#9](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/9) is related to #49
        * [#47](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/47)
        * [#46](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/46)
    These issues could be separated into a few different projects but I feel it is important to see that Tim and joined the all together.
    People have been working on the above issues but they are not finished.

* [Package all of SymbiFlow dependencies into a conda repository #14](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/14)
    I think this project will take a decent understanding of both conda and how conda handles dependencies but this could solve the problem of having multiply environments during instillation of the different tools.
    I wonder if this could be extended to move all the Symbiflow repos to conda

*

### High Understanding Required level Suggestions

* [Add a Verilog / SystemVerilog support to Sphinx #11](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/11)
    I looked into what Sphinx is and it is a documentation tool that uses reStructuredText as its markup language.
    Looking at the conversation surrounding the issue, it seems like it would be an interesting project, but I feel that it would be fairly difficult.
